| 2 | Sprint 5 Project | This project analyzes data from the same Superstore, but from a different approach. It analyzes why there are a high number of returned orders at the Superstore. It explores what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. |
| 3 | Sprint 4 Project | This project analyzes data from a Superstore. It explores the important centers of profit and loss for the Superstore. It determines what products the Superstore should stop selling and what kinds of products the store should focus on. It discovers the best combinations of states and times to advertise in and whether it is worth it to pay for advertising. It also determines what products and customers have the highest return rates. |
